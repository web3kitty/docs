The Treasury is our main financial instrument that receives all of our income (from [Membership fees](/get-involved/partnership) or [private donations](/get-involved/donate)) and redistributes these funds within our initiative.

The on-chain portion of the funds is managed through Multi-sig wallet, but Treasury also holds funds off-chain in fiat through the Association.

Treasury management is the responsibility of the [Core Team](/core-team).

## Distribution
* 30% automatically goes to [Contributors Guild](/contributors/index), eq. directly to contributors
* the remaining 70% is distributed through [Funding Requests](/resources/funding#funding-requests) to specific projects or Workgroups
