## Who is a contributor?

A *contributor* is someone who actively supports our [Mission](https://web3privacy.info/about/) by participating in our activities and [Projects](#projects). In other words, a contributor is anyone who: 

- assists in writing code and enhancing our open-source tools
- conducts research or co-edits our [research](https://github.com/orgs/web3privacy/projects/11/views/1) and [publications](https://mirror.xyz/0x0f1F3DAf416B74DB3DE55Eb4D7513a80F4841073)
- offers structured feedbacks
- volunteers at events
- initiates an entirely new project to advance our mission

Contributors are typically organized into Workgroups aligned with their skills and interests, each guided by one or more shepherds.

Frequent contributors have the opportunity to become [Core Contributors](/governance/core-contributors/) and be rewarded for their contributions to open source.

## Projects

*Project* is the basic unit of work by which we coordinate ourselves. 

An example of a project is [Research](/research) or [Events](/events) or [Privacy Explorer](/projects/privacy-explorer). Each of these top-level projects is a separate unit with its own autonomy and may have other sub-projects (such as a specific event or specific research report, etc.). 

Every project is open for collaboration!
Check our [Projects registry](https://github.com/orgs/web3privacy/projects/12)

**How to join a project**:
_If you want to get involved in a project, you can either navigate the ones we are carrying on and do pull requests (see below) or write to the people leading it, the shepherds._

**How to start new project:**
_Publish and discuss a concept of your project in our [Projects registry](https://github.com/web3privacy/projects/issues) detailing the necessary requirements for initiation and maintenance, such as timing, funding, social media outreach, and design._

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to maintain our privacy DB updated via PR at GitHub:

**Actualization**
_goal_: up to date info in the database
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Pick up a category (from DeFi to Infrastructure)
3. Check:
- product-readiness (actual state: devnet, testnet, mainnet)
- team status (public, anon)
- github/docs-readiness (available/not)
- ecosystem
- token (yes/no/Coinmarketcap link).
4. Add missing data & make a PR.

**Categorisation**
_goal_: broader list of categories within the privacy market.
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Check ["other"](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy#Other) & ["dapps"](https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy#dapps) categories.
3. Find sub-categories (min 3-4 projects per category). Examples: "marketplaces" or "data lakes".
4. Once a new sub-category has been found - create it & move those projects under it.

**Sunset**
_goal_: actual information on terminated or abandoned projects.
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Check sunset projects (Twitter &/or Discord activity, GitHub activity).
3. 6 months hiatus - mark them with an icon of the moon next to them.

**Category Accuracy**

_goal_: check Infrastructure, dApps, Other categories if projects really belong there (some projects misslead readers pretending to be infrastructure, for example)
_algorhithm_:
1. Open database https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy
2. Check projects' website, documentation.
3. Make observations if a projects belongs to particular category (infrastructure - providing broader protocol toolkit for different decentralised implementations).
4. If project nature differs from category where it exists - move it to the right category.
