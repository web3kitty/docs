## Concept

Our event concept is based on creating a unified schedule of events for the entire season and spreading events over whole year and different locations. Instead of just doing one huge event in one location that only happens for a day or two, we are trying to create something like a "distributed conference".

We aim to produce high quality events that bring a very similar atmosphere and content to many venues around the world, providing a unique experience for visitors, speakers and other participants.

## Naming conventions

### Unique event identifier (ID)

Each event has an assigned unique identifier for referencing.

The event identifier consists of:

| Length | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-2 letter | code of [event type](/events/types) | `s` |
| 2 letter | calendar year | `24` |
| 2-3 letters | pseudo city/event code | `prg` |
| 1 letter | sequence number (optional) | - |

Example identifiers:
* `s24prg` - summit in Prague 2024
* `c25bkk` - congress in Bangkok 2025
* `pc25ber` - Privacy Corner in Berlin 2025
* `mh26rom` - meta-hackathon in Rome 2026

List of event codes:

| Event Code | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| s  | summit | s24prg |
| m  | meetup | m24rom |
| h  | hackathon | h23prg |
| c  | congress | c25bkk |
| pc  | privacy-corner | pc25ber |
| os  | online-summit | os22web |
| mh  | meta-hackathon | mh26rom |

### Name of the event

The name of the event is based on its type, geographical location and year:

* `Web3Privacy Now <event-type> <city> <year>`
* `W3PN <event-type> <city> <year>`

## Seasons

In terms of time, everything is divided into individual programme seasons or planning periods. For us, this is the calendar year.

Prior to each season, each [regional team](/events/regional-teams) will prepare a unified event plan for the entire region.

Within the season, all events are prepared together as one package. This also applies to partners and speakers, which are gathered for the whole package.

### Season Budget

Each season as a whole has a predetermined budget that we want to raise from sponsors and donors. These funds are then used to cover the costs associated with organising these events.

The Season Budget consists of budget approved by Web3Privacy Now [Treasury](/governance/treasury).

## Date and location

Most of our events are held in conjunction with another major Ethereum event in the region (e.g. Devcon(nect), EthCC, ETHBerlin, ETHPrague, etc.).

Our aim is to cover these big events and offer an alternative to expand the numbers of our supporters.

We are also preparing a couple of separate events within the season, which are intended to complement our event portfolio. These may be events that fill in the less popular periods (eq. Barcelona meetup in winter) or it may be our own Web3Privacy Now hackathon or team building.

## Event types

We divide events into different types according to their length and purpose.

Example: *Summit, Meetup, Hackatho, Congressn* etc.

## Slots

Each event is composed of a predetermined number of slots.

Slots serves as a basic breakdown of the programme of each event. Each slot can be occupied by a talk, workshop, panel debate, etc. (see [Program formats](#program-formats)).

The standard duration of one slot is 30 minutes.

## Program formats

At each event, the program is made up of [slots](#slots) that are filled with different formats.

Example: *Talk, Workshop, Panel discussion* etc.
