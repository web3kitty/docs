## Guidelines

* [News items](#news-items) - divided into [categories](#categories)
* [Upcoming events](#upcoming-events)

### Categories

* Research
* Concepts
* Ecosystem
* Governments
* Releases - only software releases
* Podcasts
* Videos
* Community
* Events
* Other

### News items
```
* <text> [(<src>)]
```

* Keep it as brief and informative as possible
* Each news item must contain a link directly in the `text`
* There should only be one link in the `text`, rarely more
* The main link should be made up of words that capture the essence of the news item
* Use a Twitter/X handle in a message if it's about someone specific - e.g. `Horswap: ...., by @MicahZoltu (src)`

Usually each message has 1-2 links:
* main link - points to a specific project, report, message, etc.
* source link (optional) - points to the source of this news like article, tweet etc.

For links to pages to article with a paywall, its a good idea to use e.g. [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/), through which the whole articles are available.
