## Research we aim to conduct:

1. The Intersection of Web2, Web3, and Privacy:
 Exploring privacy from cultural practices to technological tools and the dynamics of people in these evolving ecosystems. 

2. Privacy Personas - Diverse Needs and Skillsets 
 Understanding the varying privacy requirements and competencies of individuals navigating the online world, from Web3 environments to broader digital landscapes. 

3. Full-Stack Privacy in Everyday Life :
Envisioning how comprehensive privacy solutions could integrate seamlessly into daily routines for journalists and social movements—not just for hardcore hacktivists, but for the average person. 

4. From Theory to Practical Use
 Mixnet technology, invented by David Chaum 30/40 yrs ago, now has its first practical, user-friendly application (nym.tech). why does it take so long? 

5. Privacy in Ethereum 
Ethereum ecosystem lacks detailed & actual report covering all the projects contributing to Ethereum privacy stack. This creates missunderstanding & shallow view on the state of privacy in Ethereum - when people can name several hyped projects, but can’t see a bigger “towards the full-stack privacy” picture.

6. Privacy Tech Awards:
we collected preferences of 100 key players in the space asking 4 questions:  
- What is your favourite pro-privacy project/product of 2024?
- What was the major news or key event regarding privacy in 2024?
- What is the most exciting innovation (new research, protocols, or approaches) supporting privacy?
- Doxxer of the year (any project, person, or organisation that sought to reduce privacy within the space).

Results: [link](https://portal.fileverse.io/#/0xe141365f658ae828F4e46Edb1e66827eD10D6bE7/member?chainId=100) > with all this data, it is possible to continue the research and organize it into informative infographics and content.
